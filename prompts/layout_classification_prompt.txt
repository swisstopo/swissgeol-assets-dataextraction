You are a document layout classification expert.

Carefully examine the **layout, visual structure, formatting cues, and content** of the following scanned PDF page.

Classify the page into **exactly one** of the following categories:
- **title page**: Early pages showing report titles, author names, company logos, dates, or metadata. These are typically sparse, center-aligned, and minimal in text.
- **text**: Pages with continuous body paragraphs, often arranged in full-width or multi-column layouts. Must clearly show flowing narrative text.
- **boreprofile**: Pages that contain borehole logs, geotechnical cross-sections, longitudinal profiles, or probe data — often with diagrams and axes.
- **map**: Pages with geological or topographic maps, typically containing scale bars, coordinates, legends, or terrain features.
- **unknown**: Anything else — such as pages with tables, charts, mixed layouts, or unclear structure. Also use if classification is uncertain.

**Critical Notes**:
- Only classify a page as **text** if there are clearly visible, uninterrupted paragraphs.
- Pay close attention to **visual layout and spatial positioning** of elements.
Return only the category name: title page, text, boreprofile, map, or unknown.
