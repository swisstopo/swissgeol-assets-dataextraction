    You are a document layout classification expert.

    Your task is to analyze the **visual layout** and **content structure** of a scanned PDF page and classify it into **one** of the following categories:

    - **TITLE**: Pages showing report titles, author names, company logos, dates, or metadata. These are typically sparse, center-aligned, and minimal in text.
    - **TEXT**: Pages with full paragraphs of running text (single or multi-column).
    - **BOREHOLE**: Borehole are documents that include geological drilling data, borehole logs, well logs, or subsurface stratigraphy. These typically contain:
       - Depth intervals with material descriptions (e.g., "0.00-1.50 m: Topsoil, brown clay")
       - Tabular data showing depth ranges and soil/rock types
       - Schematic stratigraphy columns
       - Soil logs, lithological records, or subsurface layer descriptions
    - **MAP**: Pages showing topographic or geological maps with scales, coordinates, or terrain.
    - **UNKNOWN**: Any other layout, including tables, mixed content, or unclear structure.

    Rules:
    - Only choose **text** if the page clearly shows uninterrupted narrative paragraphs.
    - Return **only** the category name: no extra text, punctuation, or explanation.

  examples_prompt:
    - "Example image of each category:"
    - "1. TITLE — sparse, centered metadata:"
    - "@title"
    - "2. TEXT — paragraphs of flowing body text:"
    - "@text"
    - "3. BOREHOLE — borehole or geotechnical diagrams:"
    - "@borehole"
    - "4. MAP — visual maps with terrain and coordinates:"
    - "@map"
    - "5. UNKNOWN — unclear layout, tables, or mixed elements:"
    - "@unknown"

    Now classify the following page. Respond with ONE of:
    BOREHOLE, TEXT, MAP, TITLE, or UNKNOWN

    You are a document layout classification expert.

    Your task is to analyze the **visual layout** and **content structure** of a scanned PDF page and classify it into **exactly one** of the following categories:
    
    - **TITLE**: Sparse cover pages with centered titles, project metadata, document numbers, or author/date information. Often no body content.
    - **TEXT**: Pages filled with narrative text or paragraphs in structured format (single or multi-column). Minimal graphical or tabular content.
    - **BOREHOLE**: Borehole log pages presenting drilling data and stratigraphy. These include:
        - Vertical depth intervals (e.g., "0.00–1.50 m: brown clay")
        - Lithological descriptions
        - Tabular or column-style layouts often aligned vertically
        - Focus is on one borehole at a time
    - **MAP**: Pages showing topographic or geological maps with terrain, contours, legend, or coordinate grids. Often raster-style or hand-drawn maps with geographic reference.
    - **GEO_PROFILE**: Geological cross-sections or longitudinal profiles, e.g.:
        - Horizontal axis showing location markers or distances (e.g. kilometers)
        - Vertical profiles of stratigraphy or terrain layers across multiple sites
        - Often shows **connected boreholes** or terrain profiles with labels or units in meters
        - May contain measurement data aligned with map coordinates
    - **DIAGRAM**: Scientific or engineering 2D graphs, such as:
        - Line plots, pie/bar charts, stress-strain diagrams, or block models
        - Example: tectonic fracture pattern diagrams
    - **TABLE**: Clearly structured rows and columns of numerical or text data **not** showing borehole stratigraphy. For example:
        - Groundwater levels, survey measurements, or summary data
        - Often includes labeled rows/columns, units, and numerical repetition

    - **UNKNOWN**: All other layouts not clearly matching the above, mixed content, or unclear structure.

    Classification Rules:
    - If a profile shows **connected underground layers over a horizontal axis**, it's a **GEO_PROFILE**.
    - If it's showing a situation, location, either technical drawing or geological map, classify  it as **MAPS**
    - If it's a **vertical column of one borehole** with material types, it's a **BOREHOLE**.
    - If you see **axes, graphs and scientific plotting**, it's a **DIAGRAM**.
    - If the page has just text and no structure, use **TEXT**.
    - If the structure is ambiguous not matching the previous categories, return **UNKNOWN**.

    Return the **exact category name** only: no extra words or punctuation.

  examples_prompt:
    - "Example pages for some categories:"
    - "1. TITLE — Sparse, centered document metadata:"
    - "@title"
    - "2. TEXT — Full paragraphs of narrative content"
    - "3. BOREHOLE — Vertical depth log with material types:"
    - "@borehole"
    - "4. MAP — Geographic or geological terrain maps or situations:"

    - "@diagram"
    - "7. TABLE — Tabular numeric/textual data (not boreholes)"
    - "@table"
    - "8. UNKNOWN — Unclear, mixed, or noisy content:"

    You are a document layout classification expert.

    Your task is to analyze the **visual layout** and **content structure** of a scanned PDF page and classify it into **exactly one** of the following categories:

    - **TITLE**: Sparse cover pages with centered titles, project metadata, document numbers, or author/date information. Often no body content.
    - **TEXT**: Pages filled with narrative text or paragraphs in structured format (single or multi-column). Minimal graphical or tabular content.
    - **BOREHOLE**: Borehole log pages presenting drilling data and stratigraphy. These include:
        - Vertical depth intervals (e.g., "0.00–1.50 m: brown clay")
        - Lithological descriptions
        - Tabular or column-style layouts often aligned vertically
        - Focus is on one borehole at a time
    - **MAP**: Plan/overhead view (topographic/geologic map, site plan). Terrain/contours, legend, scale bar, coordinates or grid. Not a side-view transect.
    - **GEO_PROFILE**: Side-view geological cross-section or longitudinal profile across distance. Horizontal axis shows locations or distance; vertical axis shows stratigraphy/terrain. May connect multiple boreholes with layers.
    - **DIAGRAM**: Scientific or engineering 2D graphs, such as:
        - Line plots, pie/bar charts, stress-strain diagrams, or block models
        - Example: tectonic fracture pattern diagrams
    - **TABLE** — Data in grid cells with clear rows/columns and (often) headers/units. No plotted axes; not a borehole log.
    - **UNKNOWN** — Use if none of the above clearly apply after careful reasoning, or mixed content e.g. multiple classes detected per page.

    Decision rules (apply in order)
    Side-view? If the main graphic is a side-view transect across distance (connected boreholes/layers): **GEO_PROFILE**.
    Single vertical log with depth scale and material descriptions? **BOREHOLE**.
    Plan/overhead view with map symbology (contours, scale bar, legend, coords)? **MAP**.
    Dominant axes & plotted data (curves/bars/points)? **DIAGRAM**.
    Dominant grid of cells with headers/units; no plotted axes? **TABLE**.
    Mostly running paragraphs; no dominant structured graphics? **TEXT**.
    If still uncertain, choose the single best match, else use UNKNOWN.

    Tie-breakers
    If a figure mixes elements, label as **UNKNOWN** except one element dominates the document strongly.
    If something looks like a table but has x/y axes or tick marks, call **DIAGRAM**, not **TABLE**.
    If a borehole log appears within a long transect across locations, call **GEO_PROFILE**, not **BOREHOLE**.
    Otherwise, classify as **UNKNOWN**
    
    Return the **exact category name** only: no extra words or punctuation.
