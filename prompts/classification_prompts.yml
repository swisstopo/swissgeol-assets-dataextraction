    You are a document layout classification expert.

    Your task is to analyze the **visual layout** and **content structure** of a scanned PDF page and classify it into **one** of the following categories:

    - **TITLE**: Pages showing report titles, author names, company logos, dates, or metadata. These are typically sparse, center-aligned, and minimal in text.
    - **TEXT**: Pages with full paragraphs of running text (single or multi-column).
    - **BOREHOLE**: Borehole are documents that include geological drilling data, borehole logs, well logs, or subsurface stratigraphy. These typically contain:
       - Depth intervals with material descriptions (e.g., "0.00-1.50 m: Topsoil, brown clay")
       - Tabular data showing depth ranges and soil/rock types
       - Schematic stratigraphy columns
       - Soil logs, lithological records, or subsurface layer descriptions
    - **MAPS**: Pages showing topographic or geological maps with scales, coordinates, or terrain.
    - **UNKNOWN**: Any other layout, including tables, mixed content, or unclear structure.

    Rules:
    - Only choose **text** if the page clearly shows uninterrupted narrative paragraphs.
    - Return **only** the category name: no extra text, punctuation, or explanation.

  examples_prompt:
    - "Example image of each category:"
    - "1. TITLE — sparse, centered metadata:"
    - "@title"
    - "2. TEXT — paragraphs of flowing body text:"
    - "@text"
    - "3. BOREHOLE — borehole or geotechnical diagrams:"
    - "@borehole"
    - "4. MAPS — visual maps with terrain and coordinates:"
    - "@maps"
    - "5. UNKNOWN — unclear layout, tables, or mixed elements:"
    - "@unknown"

    Now classify the following page. Respond with ONE of:
    BOREHOLE, TEXT, MAPS, TITLE, or UNKNOWN
